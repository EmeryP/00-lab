##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

For the base file I added all styles that didnt include any ID's or class selectors, only element selectors that I felt applied to the base structure of the page. For layout, I included the styles that applied to the layout of the page which I felt inclueded the big containing elements such as article, footer, nav, etc. Modulues was populated with styles I felt that added a touch of character to the page such as a clickable list element, the image and quick blurb of Vanessa, etc.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No I didnt as I ran into a time crunch.
